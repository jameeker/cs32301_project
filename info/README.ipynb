    "Our React frontend follows a modular, component-based architecture to easily separate between what code in our project is related to the frontend, and what code is related to the backend. Below is an explanation of each major directory and its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "`src/pages/`  \n",
    "The pages/ directory contains all of our app's individual pages. Each page has its own subdirectory that includes 3 main things:\n",
    "- A main JavaScript file containing the actual page component\n",
    "- A CSS styling file for that specific page\n",
    "- An index.js file that exports the entire component for cleaner imports, which is essentially all of the code for that page.\n",
    "\n",
    "`src/app/`  \n",
    "The app/ directory contains our application's core files, which are:\n",
    "- App.js: The root component that defines the overall structure and routing\n",
    "- App.css: Global styles that apply across the entire app\n",
    "- logo.svg: React logo (unnecessary but kept for now)\n",
    "\n",
    "The App.js file is basically the \"shell\" of our whole application. It imports all page components and sets up routing between them using React Router, which lets the user navigate between all of the different pages seamlessly. React Router is also needed for the different URLs throughout user navigation, and the App component determines which page component to render next. This is a good example of what it means to have a component-based project architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "`src/components/`  \n",
    "The components/ directory houses all of the reusable UI elements that are used across multiple pages in our app. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each component has its own subdirectory (ex: HomeButton/ and NavButtonBar/). Components maintain their own styles and logic, and the root index.js file (in frontend/src/components/index.js) provides a central export point that is then connected to the main app in the /app subdirectory. \n",
    "Components differ from pages because they don't represent entire views/individual webpages; they're just UI elements that can exist and be composed together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples:*\n",
    "- HomeButton: provides navigation back to the main bulletin board upon a click\n",
    "- NavButtonBar: contains the About and How-To buttons that appear consistently across all pages\n",
    "\n",
    "Using shared components allows for consistent UI across our app, reduced need for code to be duplicated and redundant, and much easier maintenance (we only need to fix the code once and it updates everywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "`Other Directories`\n",
    "\n",
    "`src/utils/:` Contains utility functions and helpers used throughout the application  \n",
    "`public/:` Houses static assets that are served directly (favicon, index.html, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It All Works Together\n",
    "\n",
    "- `index.js` is the entry point that renders the main App component.  \n",
    "- `App.js` sets up routing and the overall application structure.  \n",
    "- Different page components (from pages/) are rendered based on the current URL.  \n",
    "- Shared UI elements (from components/) are used within these pages for consistent design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new feature:  \n",
    "- Determine if it requires a new page or if it can be added to an existing one\n",
    "- If creating a new page, add a new subdirectory in pages/ with the required files\n",
    "- For reusable UI elements, create components in the components/ directory\n",
    "- Import and use these components within your page components\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of a modular structure is that it makes it easy to understand where code lives and how different parts of the application interact with each other.\n",

    "The Flask backend uses a modular, blueprint-based architecture in the same way that the React frontend is structed. It organizes code by a specific feature and is completely separate from the frontend/. Here's an explanation of each major component:\n",
    "\n",
    "`app.py`  \n",
    "This is the main entry point and core of our Flask app. The app.py file is the backend equivalent of the frontend's App.js - it orchestrates all the pieces for the backend and is the shell/foundation for everything else.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It does the following:  \n",
    "- Creates the Flask application instance  \n",
    "- Configures the app using settings from config.py  \n",
    "- Registers all blueprints (feature modules)  \n",
    "- Establishes any application-wide routes (like the health check endpoint)  \n",
    "- Runs the development server when executed  \n",
    "\n",
    "`config.py`  \n",
    "This file contains configuration settings for our Flask application like database connection parameters, secret keys and security settings, environment-specific configurations (for development, testing, and production), and CORS settings to allow frontend-backend communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a config.py file that centralizes configuration makes it easy to modify settings without changing application code.\n",
    "\n",
    "`blueprints/`  \n",
    "The blueprints/ directory contains modular components of our API, with each file representing a different feature area. Blueprints are Flask's way of componentizing backend code, similar to how we use the components/ and pages/ directories in React.\n",
    "\n",
    "bulletin_board.py: Handles all API endpoints related to the community bulletin board  \n",
    "personal_board.py: Manages personal bulletin board functionality  \n",
    "about.py: Provides information about the application  \n",
    "how_to.py: Delivers help content and usage instructions  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each blueprint file defines its own set of routes with a common URL prefix (e.g., /api/bulletin-board/). This modular structure allows for independent development and testing between each of the different pages that have unique API functionality, clean separation, and easy-to-understand code organization, where things are sectioned by feature rather than technical function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`models/`  \n",
    "\n",
    "The models/ directory will contain our databases once we eventually implement them. It'll have things like database table definitions, relationships between data entities, data validation logic, and object-relational mapping (ORM) functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, it's a placeholder with a __init__.py initial Python file, because early versions of the frontend have involved hard-coded data for the notes and content for the main bulletin board.\n",
    "\n",
    "`utils/`  \n",
    "The utils/ directory is for helper functions and utilities that may be used across multiple blueprints, similar to the utils/ subdirectory in the frontend directory. It's not yet used so it can be ignored for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Examples of what this dir will include:*\n",
    "- Common data transformation functions\n",
    "- Authentication helpers\n",
